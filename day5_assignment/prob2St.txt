`2. Railway Ticket Reservation System`  
`Scenario:`  
A `railway booking system` maintains a `queue of passengers` for reservations. The system should:  
- Add `new reservations`  
- Process bookings `in order`  
- Display `waiting list if full`  

`Operations Example:`  
```
Booking Confirmed: Passenger 1 (Alice)  
Booking Confirmed: Passenger 2 (Bob)  
Waiting List: Passenger 3 (Charlie)
