`1. Task Scheduler for Customer Support Calls`  
`Scenario:`  
A `customer support` team handles `incoming calls` on a `first-come, first-served` basis using a `queue`. The system should:  
- Add `new calls to the queue`  
- Process `calls in order`  
- Display `remaining calls in the queue`  

`Operations Example:`  
```
New Call Added:  Call 101 from Alice  
New Call Added:  Call 102 from Bob  
Processing Call: 101 from Alice  
Remaining Calls: 102 from Bob  
```
