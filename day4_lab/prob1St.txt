`1. Student Report Card using Nested Structures`  
`Problem Statement:`  
Define a `nested structure` where:  
- `Student` structure contains `ID`, `Name`, and `Marks` 
(another structure with `3 subjects`).  
- Write a program to:  
  1. Read student details for `N students`.  
  2. Compute their `total marks` and `average`.  
  3. Display details along with `grade classification` 
  (`A` for >=90%, `B` for 75-89%, etc.).  

`Function Prototypes:`  
```c
void readStudents(Student students[], int n);
void calculateGrades(Student students[], int n);
void displayStudents(Student students[], int n);
```

`Sample Test Case:`  
`Input:`  
```plaintext
Enter number of students: 2  
Enter details (ID, Name, Marks in 3 subjects):  
1 Mike 80 90 85  
2 Sarah 95 98 92  
```
`Output:`  
```plaintext
Mike - Total: 255, Average: 85, Grade: B  
Sarah - Total: 285, Average: 95, Grade: A  
```
