Let me know the scenario based problems for the above contents
and day wise also. Can you try for first day as of now.
  
For example, the below scenario is suggested from institute. 
Do sorting for the data of all india cbse's students based on highest total score.
State wise sorting based on highest total score. 
Display state wise two toppers details with marks and total.
And dislay two toppers from india.
