`3. Book Inventory Management using Unions`  
`Problem Statement:`  
Create a `union` to store different types of books:  
- `Fiction` (title, author, price)  
- `Non-Fiction` (title, subject, price)  

Write a program to:  
1. Allow users to `enter details of multiple books`.  
2. Display details of books based on their category.  

`Function Prototype:`  
```c
void addBooks();
void displayBooks();
```

`Sample Test Case:`  
`Input:`  
```plaintext
Enter number of books: 2  
Book 1: Fiction - "Harry Potter", J.K. Rowling, $30  
Book 2: Non-Fiction - "Physics Fundamentals", Science, $25  
```
`Output:`  
```plaintext
Fiction Book: Harry Potter, Author: J.K. Rowling, Price: $30  
Non-Fiction Book: Physics Fundamentals, Subject: Science, Price: $25  
```

struct Book_t {
    int type;
    union {
        struct {
            title, author, price
        } fiction;
        struct {
            title, subject, price
        } nonFiction;

};
